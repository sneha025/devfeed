# Build new-tab chrome extension

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Use this build folder to unpack load in your chrome extension manage tab while testing your extension.

## Test extension in local

After running build script from above to your chrome manage extension tab and load unpack , make sure your developer mode is enable in the same tab.
There you go, test your extension.
